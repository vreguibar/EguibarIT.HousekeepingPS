# PowerShell Best Practices for Active Directory Management

## Security Best Practices

- Use ADSI Edit or Low-Level Directory Methods for sensitive operations
- Implement proper exception handling for security-related operations
- Follow the Active Directory administrative tier model
- Filter results server-side to improve performance and security
- Use secure credential handling with SecureString objects
- Implement just-enough-administration principles

## Performance Optimization

- Use server-side filtering with LDAP filters instead of Where-Object
- Implement paging for large result sets:

  ```powershell
  $PageSize = 1000
  $SearchBase = "DC=contoso,DC=com"
  $Searcher = New-Object DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher
  $Searcher.SearchRoot = New-Object DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry("LDAP://$SearchBase")
  $Searcher.PageSize = $PageSize
  $Searcher.Filter = "(objectClass=user)"
  ````

## Cache frequently accessed data

- Minimize property retrieval with -Properties parameter
- Use batch operations where possible
- Prefer compiled .NET methods for performance-critical operations

## Error Handling Patterns

- Use specific exception types when available
- Log both exception message and stack trace for troubleshooting
- Implement retry logic for transient errors
- Use ErrorAction parameters consistently

## Logging Best Practices

- Use Write-Verbose for operation flow
- Use Write-Debug for detailed troubleshooting
- Add timestamps to log messages
- Include correlation IDs for complex operations
